# Ward Zombification

Prevents Piglins and Hoglins from turning into their zombified variants
when they are in an area which looks similar to their natural habitat.

That is: when they are standing on a block which naturally occurs in the
nether (netherrack, nylium, basalt, etc) and can't see the sky.

This is mostly intended to make "zoos" possible.

Also adds an hidden advancement to the "husbandry" tree, granted when
this occurs within 30 blocks of the player.
