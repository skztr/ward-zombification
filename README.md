# Ward Zombification

Prevents Piglins and Hoglins from turning into their zombified variants
when they are in an area which looks similar to their natural habitat.

That is: when they are standing on a block which naturally occurs in the
nether (netherrack, nylium, basalt, etc) and can't see the sky.

This is mostly intended to make "zoos" possible.
